__GOOD FIRST ISSUE LABEL:__

The issues tab of a GitHub repository is an extremely powerful tool if used effectively. It allows both the creator and contributors to provide feedback, report software bugs, and organize tasks they'd like to accomplish. I like to think about it like our CSC630 Repository Bulletin Board except this method is much more organized, reaches a wider audience, and has abundantly more capabilities.

Some examples of these elevated capabilities include:
- The ability to link pull requests to an issue and have it set up so that the issue closes automatically when someone merges the pull request. 
- The ability to link issues to project boards (repository project boards, user-owned project boards, organization project boards). 
  - Project boards are essentially notecards. The notecards progress column to column. In each notecard the creator can add to-do lists, reminders, and anything else they want to with the purpose of making the status of their project more accessible to others and organizing all of the creators work in a singular location. 
- The ability to elect to receive notifications every time an issue is created or modified.
- The ability to transfer open issues to other open source repositories.
- The ability to pin/prioritize specific issues.
- The ability to assign issues to other users.
- _The ability to tag issues with labels._

When looking at that last example, it is important to note the "good first issue" label. Not only does this signal to other users that this issue is more easily resolved, it is a special label created by GitHub with the intention of reaching beginners and encouraging them to contribute to GitHub repositories. Two of the ways GitHub accomplishes this is by:
1. Allowing users to search for issues under that label just in the general search bar. (Not specific to any repository) 
    - From there the user can also narrow their search down by language.
2. Using an algorithm that takes these "good first issues" and makes them surface in various places on their website where they have tracked high interaction among beginners. 

Using the issue tab and functions like its "good first issue" label make the atmosphere of a repository much more welcoming and accepting. They signal the creators desire to have users of all skill levels contribute and encourage open communication between those working on the project. It also makes the project more readable to those who stumble upon it.
