# Creating and Maintaining a Welcoming and Inclusive Open Source Community
## Entry 4

__OPEN DYSLEXIC FONT:__
[OpenDyslexic](https://opendyslexic.org/) is a new open sourced font created to increase readability for readers with dyslexia. While not perfect, its typeface was designed with the intention of combating some of the most common symptoms of dyslexia. Although it is not directly related to creating and maintaining a community of open source contributors, I thought it is a great example of how open source can be used to make other forums more inclusive and welcoming. 

I only recently became aware of this movement when, as I was describing my project to a friend of mine, she mentioned how games like Boggle were always harder for her because the letters were often too close together and the boxy font led to an increased resemblance between letters. She informed me that she had heard of a new font that was geared towards people with dyslexia and asked me if I knew of it. I had not, but I quickly found Open Dyslexic and am slowly implementing their font into my project’s GUI. 

In another attempt to make their product more inclusive, downloading an Open Dyslexic font is gratis, all donations are optional. It is also available on a wide array of platforms including: Android, iOS Supporting Machines, Windows, MacOS, and Linux OTF. They also have a series of scripts designed to increase readability on websites using color, font styles, and shading.  

One of the greatest aspects of Open Dyslexic is that they are still improving their work and it is still very much so a thriving open source community project. On their website they encourage others to work on Open Dyslexic either using either the [Glyphs.app]( https://glyphsapp.com/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/antijingoist/opendyslexic). They also linked their [issues]( https://github.com/antijingoist/opendyslexic/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Acomments-desc) section of GitHub.
They also use the SIL Open Font License 1.1 License which I have learned is 
> “the Open Font License (OFL) is maintained by SIL International. It attempts to be a compromise between the values of the free software and typeface design communities. It is used for almost all open source font projects, including those by Adobe, Google and Mozilla.”


Similar to an Open Source Repository on GitHub, they are also extremely transparent about who the maintainers and contributors to the project are with links to all of the maintainers GitHubs to ensure that they are easily contactable. 
They also have a [support tab]( https://desk.zoho.com/portal/abbiecodes/en/home) with a list of linked articles outlining solutions to their most common problems and a discussion board for users to talk amongst themselves or share tips and advice on how to best use the program.
