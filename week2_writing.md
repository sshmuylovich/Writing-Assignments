# Creating and Maintaining a Welcoming and Inclusive Open Source Community
## Entry 2

__BOTS:__

Upon hearing the term "bots," my mind immediately flashed to twitter bots and other forms of social media spam. Before today, I don't think I've ever heard the term used outside a negative context and I'll admit that I try and avoid bots (in all forms) at all costs. 

But what even is a bot? At its base, a bot is simply a software application that runs automated tasks (or in layman’s terms, a program that carries out a script.) It is neither inherently bad nor inherently good.

In fact, I have found that in the open-source software community, many maintainers use bots to improve their communication with and make their projects more inviting/appealing for other GitHub users. 

Welcome Bots are often used for group chats or social media. It could implement itself through a generic welcome message or, similar to the new Apple feature in iMessages, it can alert a user when a comment has been directed at them specifically. Several examples I found on GitHub include: [GitHub user shaunagm's WelcomeBot](https://github.com/shaunagm/WelcomeBot) and [GitHub user jh0ker's welcomebot](https://github.com/jh0ker/welcomebot). 

But while *Shauna Gordon-McKeon* and *Jannes Höke’s* welcome bots are geared towards third-party websites, members like *Sneha Mishra* have programmed bots that welcome users to GitHub projects themselves. 

The following image is an example of the output one of Mishra’s welcome bots produces:

This message would pop up if a user were to click on the "issues" section of the AnitaB project. Typically, a user doesn't click on the "issues" tab unless they want to take a stab at fixing the issue or they want to use parts of the code and need to understand which parts are functional and which parts aren't. Either way, the user would go a step further from viewing the page to interacting with the creator/maintainer. 

GitHub can be a really scary community to interact with if you're a beginner. Not only do you not know the people you're working with, but if you don't consider yourself an "expert" coder, it is also extremely easy to feel intimidated.

Mishra's message is effective for several reasons:

-  It's a positive, kind message filled with colourful emojis (adds personality that appeals to users, and makes the message feel less automated).
-  It's wording is all about the user. Examples: "*your* first issue," "*you* may submit," "if *you* like," "if *you* want to report," and "hope *you* have a great time."
-  It provides guidance on how to interact with the project, even linking a markdown file that serves as a bug report template.
-  It introduces the Code of Conduct and sets the rules and expectations of the community out from the get-go.
-  It encourages the user to continue thier interaction with the project by joining a larger, more interactive, discussion.


In the true spirit of open-source, Mishra has been spreading her knowledge and code to other users. We can view one of Mishra’s pull request on another library by clicking on the following [link](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT/issues/58). 

Other members, like *George Claghorn* have created bots such as [rails-bot](https://github.com/rails-bot) to comment on pull requests submitted to his [rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) GitHub library. 

We can view rails-bot in action aby clicking on the following [link](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/32582). 

If you the link isn't working, Claghorn's rails-bot response can be found below:

>Thanks for the pull request, and welcome! The Rails team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @georgeclaghorn (or someone else) soon.
>
>If any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. Due to the way GitHub handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.
>
> This repository is being automatically checked for code quality issues using Code Climate. You can see results for this analysis in the PR status below. Newly introduced issues should be fixed before a Pull Request is considered ready to review.
>
> Please see the contribution instructions for more information.

Similar to Mishra's message, Claghorn's automated response makes the user feel like they are being acknowledged and that their work isn't just lost to cyberspace.
